# Cash-Flow-Minimizer-System
A Cash-Flow Minimizer that computes net positions of banks and settles payments by iteratively matching top creditors with top debtors using a greedy algorithm. It respects common payment modes and uses a World Bank intermediary when needed. Conceptually similar to max-flow with capacities as net amounts.
